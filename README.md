<h1> Before The Process </h1>
<p> I have very little knowledge about html and css. I learned it all from freecodecamp.org and I am new to the whole coding idea. I hope to learn more and make this my full-time career. </p>

<h1> After The Process </h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTML - </strong> It was easy for me to add basic head and body elements. The tricky part was trying to add in all of the details and making sure I had everything in the right div elements.</li>
<li><strong>CSS - </strong> I had a really hard time figuring out what each thing did to the elements. I had to google a couple of things.</li>
</ul>
<p> This was the first project from The Odin Project</p>
